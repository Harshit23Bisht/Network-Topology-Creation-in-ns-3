This project implements and simulates five different network topologies using the ns-3 network simulator. Each topology contains 15–20 nodes and is visualized using NetAnim. The experiment helps in understanding how different network structures are designed and simulated in ns-3.

Topologies Implemented

Star Topology

Bus Topology

Ring Topology

Grid Topology

Tree Topology

Tools Used

ns-3 Network Simulator

NetAnim Visualization Tool

C++

How to Run

Place .cc files inside ns-3.44/scratch/

Run simulation using:

./ns3 run scratch/<filename>

Open generated .xml file in NetAnim to view topology.

Output

Each program generates an animation file showing the network structure and node connections.
